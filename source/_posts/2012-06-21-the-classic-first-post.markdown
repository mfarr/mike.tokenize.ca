This is the first post on my blog. And just like the first post on every other blog on the internet, nobody is going to read it.

Why? Because nobody knows it exists. And it's likely to stay that way until I write my breakthrough post -  the one that will lead a handful of people to my dusty corner of the internet. Maybe it'll be a post about how to [make a clutch for vim](https://github.com/alevchuk/vim-clutch), or [how to set up a blog of your own](http://octopress.org/). But probably it won't be, because I'm not that smart. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if I forget about this blog after a week and this first post ends up being my last.

Just like the first post on every other blog on the internet.
